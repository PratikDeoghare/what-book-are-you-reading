Let $B$ be the set of books and also the random variable that takes values in the set of books.

Let $X$ be the chain of words that user searched. 

To calculate $p := Prob\{ B = b | X \}$. 

Calculate $p$ for each book. 

Assumptions:
    1. User searches a difficult word.
    2. Difficult word has color 0 to 4.
    3. User memorizes the word the first time and doesn't need to look it up again. 

Remove all but the first occurence of all the words in the document. Point 3 makes it an easy word after first occurance. 
Remove all the easy words. % remove_easy_words.py
